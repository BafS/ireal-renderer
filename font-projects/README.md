# Font Creation

The font itself is a Glyphr project. Based on the Bravura font, it contains its own set of glyphs. The Glyphr project is stored as a .txt file. Go to http://www.glyphrstudio.com/online/ to edit the project.

After downloading the generated SVG file, you can edit the code points and names at https://icomoon.io/app/. The project file to load is iRealFont.json.

Some glyphs are based on the Century Schoolbook font, which is included in this folder.

See style.css in the Zip file for the font code points. Use the CSS classes defined there to display the glyphs.
